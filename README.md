# Tutteli gradle plugin
A set of gradle plugins which provide utility tasks and functions which I often use in my projects.

*You want to use one of them as well?*

Sweet :smile: the following sections will cover a few features.
They are most probably not complete
(and maybe out-dated, bear with me, as far as I know I am the only one using them).

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/robstoll/tutteli-gradle-plugins/issues/new),
if you find a bug or need some help.

The following sections give brief information what the different plugins offer.

# ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.project.utils [ðŸ”—](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.project.utils/4.10.1)
-> will most likely be removed with 5.0.0
This plugin adds utility functions to `Project` 

Currently, it provides the following functions:
- `prefixedProject(name)` which is a shortcut for `project("${rootProject.name}-$name")`.
   You find an example in the [build.gradle of the spek plugin](https://github.com/robstoll/tutteli-gradle-plugins/tree/v4.10.1/tutteli-gradle-spek/build.gradle#L20).
- `createTestJarTask` creates a task named `testJar` which creates a jar containing your test binaries
- `createTestSourcesJarTask` creates a task named `testSourcesJar` which creates a jar containing your test sources

# ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.dokka [ðŸ”—](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ch.tutteli.dokka/4.10.1)

Applies the [dokka-plugin](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka) and creates a `javadocJar` task which can be used for publishing.
Moreover, it defines a `sourceLink` per `dokkaSourceSet`. 
If the project version follows the pattern x.y.z, then an `externalDocumentationLink` per `dokkaSourceSet` is defined in addition.
The url used for the `sourceLink` and the `externalDocumentationLink` is based on a given githubUser.

# ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.junitjacoco [ðŸ”—](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ch.tutteli.junitjacoco/4.10.1)
Applies the [junit-platform-gradle-plugin](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build-gradle)
as well as the [jacoco-plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html)
and applies some default configuration.

This plugin does not set up a junit engine and you need to define it yourself. 
Have a look at [build.gradle](https://github.com/robstoll/tutteli-gradle-plugins/tree/v4.10.1/build.gradle#L61)
for an example.
In case you should use Spek as your engine, then you might want to have a look at the `spek` plugin below.

# ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.kotlin.module.info [ðŸ”—](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.kotlin.module.info/4.10.1)

Intended to be used in a kotlin project where either module-info.java is the single java source file or where >= jdk 11 is used.
It sets up compileJava accordingly and configures JavaCompile tasks to use jdk 11 for `sourceCompatibility`/`targetCompatibility` if not already set or higher. 

Per default, it reads the module name (which is used for `--patch-module`) from the defined module-info.java. 
You can speed up this process (in case you have many java files) by defining `moduleName` on `project.extra`.

# ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.kotlin.utils [ðŸ”—](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.kotlin.utils/4.10.1)
-> will most likely be removed with 5.0.0

Provides some utility functions to declare dependencies on kotlin projects, to configure projects as well as utility functions to exclude kotlin.
Requires that `kotlinutils.kotlinVersion` (property on the extension) is configured.

Following a list of functions it supports:
- declare dependencies on libs: `kotlinStdlib()`, `kotlinStdlibJs()`, `kotlinStdlibCommon()`, `kotlinReflect()`, `kotlinTestJs()`, `kotlinTestCommon()`, , `kotlinTestAnotationsCommon()`  
- exclude dependencies: `excludeKotlin`, `excludeKbox`, `excludeAtriumVerbs` (see example)
- configure projects: `configureCommonProjects`, `configureJsProjects`, `configureJvmProjects`
- `getCommonProjects()`, `getJsProjects()`, `getJvmProjects()`, `getProjectNameWithoutSuffix(project)`   

Moreover, it turns warnings into errors if one of the env variables `CI` or `WARN_AS_ERROR` is set to `true`.

You find an example in [KotlinUtilsPluginIntTest](https://github.com/robstoll/tutteli-gradle-plugins/tree/main/tutteli-gradle-kotlin-utils/src/test/groovy/ch/tutteli/gradle/kotlin/KotlinUtilsPluginIntTest.groovy#L45).

# ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.publish [ðŸ”—](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.publish/4.10.1)

Applies the `maven-publish` and `signing` plugin and 
configures them based on given license(s), a github user and a few other information.
It exposes the `tutteliPublish` extension which lets you specify those information and refine default conventions.
Have a look at the [example in the tests](https://github.com/robstoll/tutteli-gradle-plugins/tree/main/tutteli-gradle-publish/src/test/groovy/ch/tutteli/gradle/publish/PublishPluginIntTest.groovy#L41)
for more information.

If not set, it automatically propagates `version` and `group` from `rootProject` to subprojects 
(`group` of subprojects are set to "" when plugin is applied, would default to `rootProject.name`).

If no MavenPublication is defined, then it creates one which:
- automatically uses `project.components.java` if available.
- includes all Jar Tasks into the publication

Regardless if there was one or several existing MavenPublications or one was created by the plugin.
All Jar Tasks are modified in a way that they include the LICENSE(.txt) file located in the root of the rootProject
and augments the manifest file with information such as Build-Time, Kotlin-version used etc.

Last but not least, it augments the pom-file with license, developer and scm information (can be configured via the `tutteliPublish` extension)

The conventions:
- Apache 2.0 is used as default license
- project.group, project.description and project.version is used in publishing
- gpg passphrase/keyRing and keyId can either be provided by a property (if you do, gradle.properties make sense) or by System.env with the following names:

    |       prop      |         env        |
    |-----------------|--------------------|
    | gpgPassphrase   | GPG_PASSPHRASE     |
    | gpgKeyRing      | GPG_KEY_RING       | 
    | gpgKeyId        | GPG_KEY_ID         | 
- The private gpg key can also be provided via GPG_SIGNING_KEY instead of pointing to a file via gpgKeyRing    

# ch.tutteli.gradle.plugins.spek [ðŸ”—](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ch.tutteli.spek/4.10.1)
-> will most likely be removed with 5.0.0 (spek is no longer a reliable test runner IMO regarding maintenance)

Applies the junitjacoco plugin (which itself applies the junit and jacoco plugin, see two sections above) 
and sets up [Spek](http://spekframework.org/) as junit engine.
Requires that a JVM compliant kotlin plugin is applied first.
Moreover, it adds `mavenCentral()` to the repositories and sets up kotlin dependencies:
kotlin-stdlib as implementation and kotlin-reflect as testImplementation dependency -- kotlin-reflect is required by spek.
